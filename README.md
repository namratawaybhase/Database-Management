# Database-Management
Welcome to Database Management System queries collection!
Here you can find the collection of queries related to MYSQL. 

I have used MYSQL and ORCAL Database to run the quries.

The DBMS manages incoming data, organizes it, and provides ways for the data to be modified or extracted by users or other programs. 
Some DBMS examples include MySQL, Microsoft Access, SQL Server, Oracle, RDBMS.

Used Queries Like 
1)CREATE:The CREATE DATABASE statement is used to create a new SQL database.
2)ALTER:The ALTER TABLE statement is used to add, delete, or modify columns in an existing table.
3)DELETE:TO Delete rows from table.
4)INSERT:The INSERT INTO statement is used to insert new records in a table.
5)UPDATE:The UPDATE statement is used to modify the existing records in a table.
6)SELECT:The SELECT statement is used to select data from a database.
